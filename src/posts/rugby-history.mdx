Rugby football is a collective name for the team sports of rugby league and rugby union, as well as the earlier forms of football from which both games, rugby sevens and touch rugby evolved.

## Origins

Rugby is believed to have originated in the early 19th century at Rugby School in England. According to legend, a student named William Webb Ellis picked up the ball during a soccer game and ran with it, creating the basis for the game of rugby.
