Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and mounted at a height of 10 feet (3.048 m) to backboards at each end of the court.

## Origins

Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Canadian James Naismith, a physical education instructor at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Naismith was tasked with creating a new game to keep his students active indoors during the cold winter months. He wrote down 13 basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track, and thus, basketball was born.
