Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat.

## Origins

Baseball's origins are somewhat murky, but it is generally believed to have evolved from older bat-and-ball games played in England. The game was brought to North America by immigrants and began to take on its modern form in the 19th century.
