Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.

## Origins

The origins of tennis can be traced back to 12th century France, where a game called "jeu de paume" (game of the palm) was played. The modern game of tennis began to take shape in the late 19th century in England.
