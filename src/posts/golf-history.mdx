Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, does not require a standardized playing area.

## Origins

The origins of golf can be traced back to 15th century Scotland, where the game was played on the eastern coast of the country. The modern game of golf began to take shape in the 18th century.
